# Interactive Feedback Rule

- **Always Use Interactive Feedback for Questions:**
  - Whenever you want to ask a question, always call the interactive feedback MCP tool

- **Always Use Interactive Feedback Before Completion:**
  - Whenever you're about to complete a user request, call the interactive feedback MCP tool instead of simply ending the process
  - Keep calling MCP until the user's feedback is empty, then end the request

- **Required Parameters:**
  - `project_directory`: Full absolute path to the project directory
  - `summary`: Short, one-line summary of the completed work
