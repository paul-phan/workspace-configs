taskmaster let plan update to @agent/:\
  \
  This agent tools work as a bridge between Weaverse Studio and Hydrogen theme code. We plan to make it super powerful like it can analyze the codebase where 
  it running, read & write files so that when user chat with our AI agent in @builder/ studio, it can help users to generate code and apply it to the correct 
  folder like @naturelle/app/sections/ , register new section component to @naturelle/app/weaverse/components.ts .\
  The @agent communitcate with Studio with websocket and when available, the studio can get infomation of the working code base like which deps using, coding 
  style, reusable components to import to the component that will be generated. In short I want to make my AI chat bot super smart that like Claude Code, can 
  understand codebase and generate the optimized code.
