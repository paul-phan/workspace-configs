## RECENTLY COMPLETED WORK
### AI Studio Context Integration (AI-CONTEXT-001) ✅
**Completed**: 2025-01-20  
**Type**: Level 2 System Enhancement  
**Impact**: High - Enhanced AI context awareness with intelligent mode detection

**Key Results**:
- ✅ **Studio Context Integration** - Added studioContext alongside existing devContext for AI requests
- ✅ **Backend Classification** - Backend handles dev/studio mode selection with intelligent routing
- ✅ **Tool Optimization** - Removed redundant getProjectContext tool, simplified architecture  
- ✅ **Debug Capabilities** - Comprehensive console logging for system prompt generation
- ✅ **Enhanced AI Workflows** - Mandatory workflows requiring AI to fetch current data before modifications

**Technical Achievements**:
- Updated request schemas to handle both devContext and studioContext
- Enhanced AI prompt generation with studio-specific context and workflows
- Streamlined frontend to send all context data for backend classification
- Established clear separation between overview data (studioContext) and detailed execution data (tools)

**Architecture Impact**:
```
Frontend → Sends both devContext & studioContext → Backend Classification → Mode-Specific Prompts
                                                   ↓
                                    AI Tools + Enhanced Workflows for Modifications
```
