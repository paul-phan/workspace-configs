## TASK CONTEXT: Two-Stage AI Code Generation Workflow

### Task ID: AI-CODEGEN-001
**Task Type**: Feature Enhancement
**Mode**: Development
**Priority**: High
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Subtasks 9.1, 9.2 & 9.3 Complete
**Created**: 2025-01-20
**Assigned**: AI Assistant

### TASK DESCRIPTION
**Objective**: Implement a two-stage AI model workflow for enhanced code generation in developer mode
**Scope**: Use vercelModel for initial React code generation, then refine with Claude for Weaverse best practices

**Background**: Current code generation uses a single model. By leveraging vercelModel's strength in React/UI generation and Claude's understanding of Weaverse patterns, we can produce higher quality component code.

### IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS

#### ✅ Completed: Subtask 9.1 - Integrate vercelModel API
**Status**: DONE
**Key Changes**:
- Updated `image-provider.ts` to load and use `image-to-section.md` prompt
- Added system prompt to vercelModel's generateText call
- Implemented proper error handling and logging
- Added fallback prompt for robustness
- Set temperature=0 and maxTokens=4000 for consistent output

#### ✅ Completed: Subtask 9.2 - Integrate Claude API for Code Refinement
**Status**: DONE
**Key Changes**:
- Created `claude-refinement.md` prompt specifically for refinement stage
- Updated `streamWeaverseCode` to detect refinement stage automatically
- Added intelligent prompt selection based on message context
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing workflow
- **Enhanced with Tailwind CSS v4 requirements**:
  - Critical styling guidelines (important modifiers at beginning: `!text-red-500`)
  - Modern Tailwind v4 syntax and configuration options
  - Validation against Tailwind v4 requirements
  - Leverage new v4 features (container queries, color spaces)
  - Responsive design with proper breakpoint usage

#### ✅ Completed: Subtask 9.3 - Develop Two-Stage Workflow Logic
**Status**: DONE
**Key Changes**:
- Created `TwoStageWorkflowOrchestrator` class for robust workflow management
- Implemented comprehensive error handling with custom error types
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Built-in fallback mechanism to single-stage if two-stage fails
- Progress tracking callbacks for UI feedback
- React code validation between stages
- Configurable workflow options (enable/disable, retry attempts, fallback)
- Enhanced `handleImageToSectionNew` to use orchestrator
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing API

**Key Findings**:
- Claude integration was already functional in `streamWeaverseCode`
- Two-stage workflow confirmed and optimized:
  - Stage 1: vercelModel generates React code with image-to-section.md prompt
  - Stage 2: Claude refines with claude-refinement.md prompt for Weaverse best practices + Tailwind CSS v4
- Automatic detection of refinement stage based on message patterns
- Production-ready workflow with robust error handling

### STYLING REQUIREMENTS
**CRITICAL**: This project uses **Tailwind CSS v4**. All generated code must follow v4-specific syntax:
- Important modifiers: `!text-red-500` (NOT `text-red-500!`)
- Modern v4 features: container queries, color spaces
- Proper responsive design patterns
- Semantic class combinations

### NEXT STEPS
- **Subtask 9.4**: Update Developer Mode UI for Two-Stage Workflow (PENDING)
- Continue implementing remaining subtasks
